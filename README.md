A.	To set up a Python development environment, first create a virtual environment using python -m venv .venv in your project root, and activate it (source .venv/bin/activate for Linux/macOS or .venv\Scripts\activate for Windows). 

B.	Then install your dependencies and save them with pip freeze > requirements.txt. Make sure to add .venv/ to your .gitignore to avoid committing virtual environment files. Organize your project with folders like src/, tests/, notebooks/, and scripts/, and use .vscode/settings.json to configure your Python interpreter if youâ€™re using VS Code.
