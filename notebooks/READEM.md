In Task 2, a comprehensive set of data profiling, cleaning, and exploratory data analysis (EDA) techniques were applied across individual country datasets. The process began with data inspection using methods like .head(), .info(), and .describe() to understand structure, data types, and basic statistics. This was followed by identifying and handling missing values through .isnull().sum() and appropriate imputation or removal strategies using .fillna() and .dropna(). Column names were standardized, duplicates were removed, and data types were converted as needed for consistency. Categorical values were cleaned, and date fields were parsed into proper datetime objects to enable temporal analysis.
